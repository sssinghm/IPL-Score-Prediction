# IPL Score Prediction using Deep Learning
This project builds a deep learning model to predict the final score of an IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket innings based on real match data. It uses player, team, and match context as input features, including batting team, bowling team, venue, overs, runs, wickets, and individual player information.

## Key Features
Data preprocessing and feature encoding for categorical variables

MinMax scaling for numerical stability

Deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras

Custom loss function (Huber Loss) to handle outliers in target values

Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Interactive input interface using ipywidgets in Jupyter Notebook

## Technologies Used
Python (3.10)

TensorFlow / Keras

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Seaborn, Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
